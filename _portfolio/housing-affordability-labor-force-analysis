## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between housing affordability and labor force participation across U.S. counties using 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) data. Using multiple regression models and interaction terms, it evaluates whether housing cost burdens are associated with workforce participation rates.

## Why This Project Is Useful
Housing affordability is often cited as a barrier to workforce participation, but the strength and consistency of this relationship is unclear. This project demonstrates how quantitative analysis and regression modeling can be used to test policy assumptions, interpret null results, and identify other structural factors influencing labor outcomes.

## Get Started
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies. Open `housing_affordability_analysis.logo` and run it from top to bottom to reproduce the analysis.

## Data
Source: 2023 American Community Survey (5-Year Estimates). The dataset includes county-level measures of labor force participation, housing affordability, population density, educational attainment, income by race, and state-level controls.

## Maintainers and Contributors
This project was developed and is maintained by: Gabrielle Dominique.
