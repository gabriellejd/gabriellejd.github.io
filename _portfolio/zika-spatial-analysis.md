## Project Overview
This project evaluates municipality-level vulnerability to Zika virus transmission in Brazil using spatial and socioeconomic data. A composite **Zika Vulnerability Index** was developed by integrating climate conditions, land use patterns, population density, and access to sanitation to identify regions at elevated risk.

The analysis highlights how environmental factors and infrastructure disparities interact to influence public health outcomes.

---

### Why This Project Matters
Vector-borne diseases such as Zika are driven by more than climate alone. Urbanization patterns, water access, and population density play a critical role in shaping exposure risk.

This project demonstrates how **spatial analytics and GIS methods** can be used to:
- Combine environmental and socioeconomic datasets
- Identify geographic disparities in disease vulnerability
- Support data-driven public health planning and targeted interventions

---

### Data Sources
- **Brazilian Ministry of Health (DATASUS)** – sanitation and water access  
- **WorldClim** – bioclimatic temperature and precipitation  
- **IBGE** – municipal boundaries and population data  
- **MapBiomas** – land use and land cover data  

Data spans multiple years and includes vector, raster, and tabular formats, harmonized for municipal-level analysis.

---

### Methods & Tools
- Spatial data preprocessing and harmonization  
- GIS-based variable integration  
- Composite index construction  

**Tools:** ArcGIS Pro

---

### Outcome
The resulting vulnerability index identifies municipalities with overlapping environmental and infrastructure risk factors, providing a framework for prioritizing surveillance and intervention efforts.
