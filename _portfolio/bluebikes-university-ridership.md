## Project Overview
This project analyzes Bluebikes ridership in the Boston area to assess whether university campus characteristics help explain usage patterns. Using spatial analysis and regression modeling, it evaluates proximity to bike stations, transit access, and student population density.

## Why This Project Is Useful
Micromobility systems are often assumed to be driven primarily by urbanization and proximity to transit infrastructure. Given that this analysis focuses on Boston—a city with a dense concentration of universities—this project explores whether student presence and campus location are additional drivers of bikeshare usage.

The results help identify which commonly assumed predictors are weak or overstated, offering more realistic insights for transportation planning and micromobility investment decisions.

## Methods & Tools
- Spatial analysis (proximity, buffers, joins)
- Regression modeling
- R (RMarkdown workflow)

## Data
- Bluebikes ridership data  
- Boston-area college and university locations  
- MBTA subway stop data  

All datasets are publicly available and used for analytical purposes.
