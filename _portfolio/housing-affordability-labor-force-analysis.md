## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between housing affordability and labor force participation across U.S. counties using 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) data. Using multiple regression models and interaction terms, it evaluates whether housing cost burdens are associated with workforce participation rates.

## Why This Project Is Useful
Housing affordability is often cited as a barrier to workforce participation, but the strength and consistency of this relationship is unclear. This project demonstrates how quantitative analysis and regression modeling can be used to test policy assumptions, interpret null results, and identify other structural factors influencing labor outcomes.

The results provide insight into which housing cost burdens are most strongly associated with workforce participation, helping policymakers and researchers target interventions more effectively.

## Methods & Tools
- Multiple regression modeling with interaction terms  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- R / RMarkdown workflow  

## Data
- 2023 American Community Survey (5-Year Estimates)  
- County-level measures: labor force participation, housing affordability, population density, educational attainment, income by race, state-level controls  

All datasets are publicly available and used for analytical purposes.
