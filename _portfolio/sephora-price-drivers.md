## Project Overview
This project analyzes Sephora product data to examine what drives beauty product pricing and consumer ratings. Using exploratory data analysis and multiple predictive models, it evaluates the influence of brand, size, product category, and engagement metrics on price and perceived value.

## Why This Project Is Useful
In a highly competitive beauty industry, brands must justify pricing and differentiate products beyond marketing. This project demonstrates how business analytics and modeling can be used to identify pricing drivers and distinguish between objective signals (price) and subjective signals (ratings), supporting data-informed pricing and product strategy decisions.

## Methods & Tools
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis  
- Feature engineering (brand, size, category, engagement metrics)  
- Regression and predictive modeling  
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

## Data
**Source:** Kaggle – Sephora Products & Skincare Reviews  
Data includes product pricing, ratings, review counts, categories, brand, and size information.

## Results
The analysis highlights how brand strength, product category, and consumer engagement influence pricing differently than ratings, illustrating gaps between perceived value and price positioning.
