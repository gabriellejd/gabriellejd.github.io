## Hi, I’m Gabrielle! 

I’m a data analyst with a background in economics and computer science and currently in graduate school studying data analytics at Tufts University. My work focuses on using quantitative analysis, spatial data, and statistical modeling to support data-driven decision-making.


I'm interested in **business analytics** as decision support, using data to help make confident choices. I’m especially drawn to problems where information is imperfect, systems are still evolving, and analytics can bring structure to ambiguity.

Through my work and coursework in data analytics, I’ve focused on turning raw, messy data into insights that support strategy, operations, and planning. I enjoy building models, dashboards, and analyses that don’t just explain what happened, but help answer what should we do next.
